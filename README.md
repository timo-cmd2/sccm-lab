# sccm-lab
Some of my scripts, regfiles, gpos and miscellaneous files for my sccm testing lab

- setup winsrv 2012 R2 iso
- custom packaging logic using wget and yaml
- setup mssql server
- testing environment using docker
- more to follow **wip**...

## Concepts I'm trying to get work

- SAP 32bit on Ubuntu
- Custom Office deployments
- Testing PXE-boot on docker images
- Managing fake clients using docker and sccm collections with wmi filters
- Deployment (install/uninstall) with docker
- Serverless Distribution-Points
  - **No local package storage** using wget and cURL/temp

## A sample SCCM package

```yaml
todo
```

### Filestructure
